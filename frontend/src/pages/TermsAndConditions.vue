            Unless a representation, which may be subject to change without
            notice from time to time, is expressed to be given at a specific
            date, each representation is deemed to be repeated by you each time
            you use the Application. When a representation is repeated, it is
            applied to the circumstances existing at the time of repetition. You
            accept that Golem does not hold an obligation to verify your status
            with respect to your representations or obligations under the Terms.
